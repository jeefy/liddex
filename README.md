##Laboratory Information Digital Data Exchange##

Central lab information hub that allows data exchange between institutions and third party services. 

Data sources specify what data they want sent and received and by default, all patient data is de-identified automatically.

Third party services can be subscribed to by default or sent per message.

Data is serialized in JSON, refer to documentation for formatting. :)

This is an updated effort based on https://code.google.com/p/liddex/
